# Prework - MPP

Submitted by: Andy Mateo

MPP is an app that... changes the background when you click the button

Time spent:2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [ ] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [ ] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 
## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Snapchat
Whatsapp
Instagram
The above are my favorite applications because you can delete messages - although more importantly you can change the background of all these applications with one of their set prefixes. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
The settings and tutorial as illustrated on the webpage don't follow 1-1 to the options available in the app as a result of new updates. It would be nice if you were able to upload a photo that could interact with that system in order to change the background to any image youd like - for example yourself.
